# Synthesis Research Mode

**When:** Integrating diverse sources, building frameworks, creating unified models
**Cognitive Style:** Integrative, pattern-finding, constructive
**Output:** Integrated models, frameworks, unified theories

## Characteristics

- Connect ideas across domains and sources
- Identify patterns and meta-patterns
- Build conceptual frameworks
- Resolve apparent contradictions
- Create new understanding from existing pieces
- Balance fidelity to sources with novel integration

## Synthesis Process

```
1. COLLECTION
   - Gather key findings from prior research
   - Identify core concepts from each source
   
2. DECOMPOSITION
   - Break findings into atomic claims
   - Identify underlying assumptions
   
3. PATTERN FINDING
   - What themes repeat across sources?
   - What structures appear in multiple domains?
   
4. TENSION IDENTIFICATION
   - Where do sources disagree?
   - Are disagreements real or terminological?
   
5. INTEGRATION
   - How do pieces fit together?
   - What framework unifies the findings?
   
6. NOVEL CONTRIBUTION
   - What does the synthesis reveal?
   - What questions does it generate?
```

## Integration Patterns

### Complementary Integration
Sources address different aspects of same phenomenon.
→ Combine into multi-faceted model

### Hierarchical Integration
Sources operate at different levels of abstraction.
→ Build layered framework

### Dialectical Integration
Sources present opposing views.
→ Synthesize thesis + antithesis into higher understanding

### Analogical Integration
Sources from different domains share structure.
→ Extract abstract pattern applicable to both

## Synthesis Template

```markdown
## Synthesis: [Topic]

### Sources Integrated
1. [Source/Finding 1] — Core contribution
2. [Source/Finding 2] — Core contribution
3. [Source/Finding 3] — Core contribution

### Key Patterns Identified
- [Pattern 1]: Appears in [sources]
- [Pattern 2]: Appears in [sources]

### Tensions Resolved
- [Apparent contradiction]: Resolved by [explanation]

### Integrated Framework

[Description or diagram of unified model]

### Novel Insights
- [What the synthesis reveals that no single source shows]

### Limitations
- Integration assumes: [assumptions]
- Does not account for: [gaps]

### Implications
- For theory: [implications]
- For practice: [implications]
```

## Quality Criteria

Good synthesis should:
- Be faithful to original sources
- Add value beyond mere aggregation
- Resolve rather than ignore tensions
- Generate new questions or predictions
- Be actionable or illuminating

## Output Structure

```markdown
## Integrated Framework: [Topic]

### Executive Summary
[2-3 sentence overview of synthesized understanding]

### Components
[Key elements of the framework]

### Relationships
[How components connect]

### Mechanisms
[How the framework operates]

### Boundary Conditions
[When framework applies/doesn't]

### Applications
[How to use the framework]

### Open Questions
[What synthesis reveals we don't know]
```

## When to Use

- Literature review conclusions
- Theory building
- Creating mental models
- Integrating conflicting advice
- Building unified understanding

## Combines Well With

- `exploratory` — Explore first, then synthesize
- `systematic` — Systematic gathering, then synthesis
- `explanatory` — Synthesize into causal framework
