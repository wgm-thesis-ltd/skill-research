# Explanatory Research Mode

**When:** Understanding "why", causal mechanisms, theoretical inquiry
**Cognitive Style:** Analytical, connecting, theory-building
**Output:** Mechanism models, causal chains, theoretical frameworks

## Characteristics

- Focus on causation, not just correlation
- Build causal chains and mechanism maps
- Identify necessary vs sufficient conditions
- Consider counterfactuals
- Connect to existing theoretical frameworks
- Distinguish proximate from ultimate causes

## Causal Analysis Framework

```
1. PHENOMENON IDENTIFICATION
   - What exactly needs explaining?
   - Precise specification of outcome
   
2. CANDIDATE MECHANISMS
   - What processes could produce this?
   - List potential causal pathways
   
3. EVIDENCE GATHERING
   - What evidence supports each mechanism?
   - What would falsify each?
   
4. MECHANISM EVALUATION
   - Which mechanisms have strongest support?
   - How do they interact?
   
5. MODEL CONSTRUCTION
   - Build causal model
   - Identify feedback loops
   - Note boundary conditions
```

## Causal Mapping Template

```markdown
## Mechanism Map: [Phenomenon]

### Phenomenon
[Precise description of what we're explaining]

### Proximate Causes
- [Immediate cause] → [Phenomenon]
  Evidence: [Reference]
  
### Intermediate Mechanisms
- [Distal cause] → [Intermediate] → [Proximate] → [Phenomenon]
  Evidence: [Reference]

### Ultimate/Root Causes
- [Deep cause underlying the chain]

### Feedback Loops
- [A] → [B] → [A] (reinforcing/balancing)

### Boundary Conditions
- Mechanism operates when: [conditions]
- Mechanism fails when: [conditions]

### Alternative Explanations
- [Alternative mechanism]
  - Evidence for: [...]
  - Evidence against: [...]
```

## Questions to Drive Analysis

- Why does X happen?
- What causes X?
- How does X lead to Y?
- Under what conditions does the mechanism operate?
- What would happen if X were removed?
- Is X necessary? Sufficient? Both?

## Output Structure

```markdown
## Explanatory Analysis: [Topic]

### The Question
Why [phenomenon]?

### Key Mechanism
[Primary causal explanation]

### Causal Chain
[A] → [B] → [C] → [Phenomenon]

### Supporting Evidence
- [Evidence for each link in chain]

### Alternative Explanations Considered
- [Alternative 1]: [Why rejected/accepted]

### Confidence Assessment
- Mechanism confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
- Key uncertainties: [List]

### Implications
- If this mechanism is correct, then [predictions]
```

## When to Use

- Theoretical research
- Root cause analysis
- Understanding historical events
- Scientific explanation
- Policy mechanism analysis

## Combines Well With

- `investigative` — First establish facts, then explain
- `comparative` — Compare explanatory frameworks
- `synthesis` — Integrate multiple mechanisms
