# Rapid Research Mode

**When:** Time pressure, quick answers, preliminary scoping
**Cognitive Style:** Efficient, focused, satisficing
**Output:** Quick summaries, key facts, actionable answers

## Characteristics

- Prioritize speed over completeness
- Satisfice rather than optimize
- Focus on "good enough" answers
- Single-pass research, minimal iteration
- Clear about confidence limitations
- Know when to recommend deeper research

## Time Budget Framework

| Time Available | Approach |
|----------------|----------|
| < 5 minutes | Single source, top result |
| 5-15 minutes | 2-3 sources, quick triangulation |
| 15-30 minutes | Focused search, key sources only |
| 30-60 minutes | Abbreviated systematic approach |

## Rapid Protocol

```
1. CLARIFY (1 min)
   - What specific question needs answering?
   - What would "good enough" look like?
   
2. SEARCH (2-5 min)
   - Use most authoritative source first
   - Check 1-2 additional sources if critical
   
3. EXTRACT (2-5 min)
   - Pull key facts directly relevant to question
   - Note confidence level
   
4. DELIVER (1 min)
   - Answer the question directly
   - State limitations clearly
   - Recommend follow-up if needed
```

## Quick Assessment Checklist

Before delivering rapid answer:
- [ ] Answered the actual question asked?
- [ ] Source is reasonably authoritative?
- [ ] Stated confidence level?
- [ ] Flagged if deeper research needed?

## Output Format

```markdown
## Quick Answer: [Question]

**Answer:** [Direct answer in 1-2 sentences]

**Key Facts:**
- [Fact 1]
- [Fact 2]

**Source:** [Primary source used]

**Confidence:** [High/Medium/Low]

**Caveat:** [Key limitation or assumption]

**Deeper Research Needed?** [Yes/No] — [Why]
```

## When to Escalate

Stop rapid mode and recommend deeper research when:
- Answer has significant consequences
- Sources conflict on key points
- Question is more complex than expected
- Confidence is low on important claim
- User seems to need comprehensive answer

## Escalation Template

```markdown
**Quick Assessment Complete**

I can give you a preliminary answer, but this topic warrants 
deeper research because: [reason]

**Preliminary Finding:** [Quick answer]

**Why Deeper Research:** [Specific concern]

**Recommended:** Switch to [systematic/investigative] mode 
for [specific aspect]
```

## Rapid vs Other Modes

| Aspect | Rapid | Other Modes |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Iterations | 1 | Multiple |
| Sources | 1-3 | Many |
| Confidence | Satisficing | High |
| Documentation | Minimal | Full |
| Time | Minutes | Hours |

## When to Use

- Quick fact lookups
- Preliminary scoping
- Time-sensitive decisions
- Low-stakes questions
- Initial orientation

## Combines Well With

- `investigative` — Quick verification of specific claims
- `exploratory` — Rapid landscape scan before deep dive
