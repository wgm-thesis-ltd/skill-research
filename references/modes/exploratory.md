# Exploratory Research Mode

**When:** Unknown territory, early-stage investigation, landscape mapping
**Cognitive Style:** Divergent, curious, open-ended
**Output:** Landscape maps, opportunity identification, question generation

## Characteristics

- Cast wide net initially, narrow progressively
- Generate hypotheses rather than verify them
- Document "unknown unknowns" discovered
- Flexible methodology, adapt to findings
- Serendipity welcome—follow interesting threads

## Iteration Pattern

```
Round 1: Broad survey
  → Identify major themes, key players, terminology
  
Round 2: Theme deep-dives
  → Explore 2-3 most promising themes
  
Round 3: Connection mapping
  → How do themes relate? What's missing?
  
Round 4: Synthesis
  → Landscape map with open questions
```

## Search Strategy

- Start with overview sources (Wikipedia, review articles)
- Follow citation trails in interesting directions
- Use semantic search for related concepts
- Look for unexpected connections

## Output Structure

```markdown
## Landscape Map: [Topic]

### Major Themes
1. [Theme] — Brief description, key sources
2. [Theme] — Brief description, key sources

### Key Players/Authors
- [Name] — Known for, affiliation

### Open Questions
- [Question discovered during exploration]

### Unexpected Findings
- [Surprise that shifts understanding]

### Recommended Next Steps
- [Where to go deeper]
```

## When to Transition Out

- Major themes identified and stable
- Diminishing returns on new discoveries
- Ready to systematize findings
- User requests more focused approach

## Combines Well With

- `synthesis` — After exploration, integrate findings
- `systematic` — When ready to exhaustively cover a theme
