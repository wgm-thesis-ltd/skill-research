# Comparative Research Mode

**When:** Choosing between options, trade-off analysis, decision support
**Cognitive Style:** Evaluative, balanced, multi-criteria
**Output:** Decision matrices, trade-off analysis, recommendations

## Characteristics

- Define comparison criteria explicitly
- Apply criteria consistently across options
- Acknowledge trade-offs, not just winners
- Consider stakeholder perspectives
- Weight criteria by importance
- Document assumptions and constraints

## Comparison Framework

```
1. OPTION IDENTIFICATION
   - What options are being compared?
   - Are options mutually exclusive?
   
2. CRITERIA DEVELOPMENT
   - What matters for this decision?
   - How will criteria be weighted?
   
3. DATA GATHERING
   - Gather evidence for each option × criterion
   - Note data quality and gaps
   
4. SCORING
   - Rate each option on each criterion
   - Document rationale for scores
   
5. ANALYSIS
   - Calculate weighted scores
   - Sensitivity analysis on weights
   
6. RECOMMENDATION
   - Best option(s) with rationale
   - Conditions where recommendation changes
```

## Decision Matrix Template

```markdown
## Comparison: [Decision Context]

### Options
1. [Option A] — Brief description
2. [Option B] — Brief description
3. [Option C] — Brief description

### Criteria (weighted)
| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| [Criterion 1] | 0.3 | [What it measures] |
| [Criterion 2] | 0.25 | [What it measures] |
| [Criterion 3] | 0.25 | [What it measures] |
| [Criterion 4] | 0.2 | [What it measures] |

### Scoring Matrix
| Option | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | Weighted |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----------|
| A | 4 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 3.55 |
| B | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 3.70 |
| C | 5 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 3.55 |

Scale: 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent)

### Trade-off Analysis
- A vs B: [Key trade-off]
- B vs C: [Key trade-off]
- A vs C: [Key trade-off]

### Sensitivity Analysis
- If [criterion] weight increases: [Option X] becomes preferred
- Recommendation is robust to: [weight changes]
```

## Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Excellent — Best in class |
| 4 | Good — Above average |
| 3 | Adequate — Meets requirements |
| 2 | Poor — Below requirements |
| 1 | Unacceptable — Fails requirement |

## Output Structure

```markdown
## Comparative Analysis: [Decision]

### Context
[Why this comparison is needed]

### Options Compared
[List with brief descriptions]

### Key Criteria
[What matters most and why]

### Decision Matrix
[Table with scores]

### Key Trade-offs
[What you give up with each choice]

### Recommendation
**Preferred:** [Option] because [rationale]

**Conditions:** This recommendation assumes [assumptions].
Consider [alternative] if [conditions change].

### Minority Considerations
[Why someone might choose differently]
```

## When to Use

- Technology selection
- Vendor evaluation
- Framework comparison
- Policy option analysis
- Investment decisions

## Combines Well With

- `systematic` — Gather evidence before comparing
- `investigative` — Verify claims about options
- `synthesis` — Integrate comparison into broader framework
