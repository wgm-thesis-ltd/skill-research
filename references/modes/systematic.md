# Systematic Research Mode

**When:** Exhaustive coverage required, evidence synthesis, literature reviews
**Cognitive Style:** Methodical, rigorous, comprehensive
**Output:** Complete evidence base, quality-assessed findings

## Characteristics

- Document search strategy explicitly
- Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria consistently
- Track all sources screened (PRISMA-style)
- Assess source quality for each finding
- Every claim traceable to source
- Reproducible methodology

## PRISMA-Style Workflow

```
1. IDENTIFICATION
   - Define search terms
   - Select databases/sources
   - Execute searches
   - Record: N results per source

2. SCREENING
   - Remove duplicates
   - Title/abstract screening
   - Apply inclusion criteria
   - Record: N excluded with reasons

3. ELIGIBILITY
   - Full-text review
   - Apply exclusion criteria
   - Assess quality
   - Record: N excluded with reasons

4. INCLUSION
   - Final source set
   - Extract data
   - Synthesize findings
   - Record: N included
```

## Search Documentation Template

```markdown
## Search Strategy

### Databases Searched
- [Database]: [date], [N results]

### Search Terms
Primary: [terms]
Boolean: [full query]

### Inclusion Criteria
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

### Exclusion Criteria
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

### Screening Results
| Stage | Screened | Included | Excluded |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| Identification | N | — | — |
| Screening | N | N | N |
| Eligibility | N | N | N |
| Final | — | N | — |
```

## Quality Assessment

For each included source, assess:
- Source reliability (A/B/C/D)
- Methodology quality
- Potential biases
- Recency/currency

## Output Structure

```markdown
## Systematic Review: [Topic]

### Methodology
[Search strategy documentation]

### Included Sources
| Source | Type | Quality | Key Finding |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| [Ref] | [Type] | [A-D] | [Finding] |

### Synthesized Findings
1. [Finding] — Supported by N sources
2. [Finding] — Supported by N sources

### Gaps in Evidence
- [What's missing from literature]

### Confidence Assessment
- Overall confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
- Limiting factors: [List]
```

## When to Use

- Literature reviews
- Evidence-based decision making
- Policy analysis
- Due diligence requiring audit trail

## Combines Well With

- `comparative` — After gathering evidence, compare options
- `synthesis` — Integrate systematic findings into framework
